## Toy Data

Toy data reflecting African and European populations are located in **data/pop_africa/** and **data/pop_europe/**. Each folder                                                      
contains **(1)** GWAS summary stats file(s), **(2)** genotype file(s) (plink format), and **(3)** phenotype file(s) (txt format),                                                   
as well as a population config file that lists the path to each file.   For more information on filetype requirements                                                               
or how create population configuration files for your own data, please see  [Guide: Input Data](guide_input.md).
