## Toy Data

Toy data reflecting African, European and East Asian populations are
located in the directories **data/pop_AFR/**, **data/pop_EUR/** and
**data/pop_EAS/**. Each directory contains **(1)** GWAS summary stats
file(s), **(2)** genotype file(s) (plink format), and **(3)**
phenotype file(s) (txt format), as well as a population config file
that lists the path to each file.  For more information on file type
requirements or how to create population configuration files for your
own data, see [Guide: Input Data](guide_input.md).
