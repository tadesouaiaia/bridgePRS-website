## Toy Data

Toy data reflecting African and European populations are located in
the directories **data/pop_africa/** and **data/pop_europe/**. Each
directory contains **(1)** GWAS summary stats file(s), **(2)**
genotype file(s) (plink format), and **(3)** phenotype file(s) (txt
format), as well as a population config file that lists the path to
each file.  For more information on file type requirements or how to
create population configuration files for your own data, see [Guide:
Input Data](guide_input.md).
