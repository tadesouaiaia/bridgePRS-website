# Interpreting results 

The easyrun command used in the previous step runs the entire bridgePRS multi-ancestry 
pipeline and produces output in the following five subdirectories:  

1. `prs-single_AFR/quantify:` Weights, predictions, and performance metrics. 
2. `model_EUR/prior:`          Model weights and priors. 
3. `prs-prior_AFR/quantify/:`  Weights, predictions, and performance metrics. 
4. `prs-combined_AFR/:`        Analysis that combined the previous three steps. 
5. `prs-port_AFR/quantify/:`   Weights, predictions, and performance metrics.
