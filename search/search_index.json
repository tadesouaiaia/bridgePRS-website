Background PRS require as input summary statistics from genome wide association studies. If you are unfamiliar with GWAS or need a refresher consider reading this paper . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve analyzing the genomes of a large group of individuals. This involves testing millions of genetic variants (SNP) for association with a particular trait. For a binary trait (like blue or brown eyes) this involves comparing the frequency of genetic variations in each group to produce an odds-ratio (measure of association) and a p-value to measure the signficance of the realtionship at each SNP. For continuous measures (like height) this results in an effect size (measure of continuous association) and p-value that measure the significance of our relationship. GWAS results can be summarized in a sumstats file which looks like this: CHR ID REF A1 A1_FREQ OBS_CT SE BETA P 1 rs100 A T 0.1 100 0.01 1.10 0.01 2 rs200 C G 0.2 100 0.02 -1.10 0.05 3 rs300 G A 0.3 100 0.03 1.02 0.10 PRS basics Creating individual polygenic scores involves combine information across many genetic variants. A score is calculated by summing the genetic association values (beta-weights) for each allele in an individual, therefore, variants with stronger associations have a larger impact on the overall score. PRS software use different statistical methods to select variants and estimate their effect sizes beta for use in the PRS. BridgePRS, like many other PRS methods, require genotype and phenotype data from individuals (several hundred samples) in addition to GWAS summary statistics to estimate the PRS. The predictive power of PRS is assessed in genotype and phenotype data from unseen samples. BridgePRS reports PRS accuracy by the residual variance explained \\(R^2\\) (accounting for the variance explained by the non-genetic covariates included in the model). For binary traits Nagelkerke \\(R^2\\) is used. Cross Population Analysis The PRS Portability Problem Often when a PRS trained using data from one population, e.g. European, is applied to a population of different ancestry, e.g. African, the PRS model is less predictive. Often there is insufficient data in the non-European populations to estimate good ancestry specific PRS using this data alone. Using single ancestry PRS methods researchers are left with two choices: An underpowered PRS model estimated using only data the target non-European population. A PRS estimated using a well powered GWAS from another population The BridgePRS Solution BridgePRS solves this problem by combining GWAS summary statistics from two populations, typically a large well powered GWAS from a \"base\" population, e.g. European, and a smaller GWAS from the target population, eg African. This is implemented by estimating a PRS in the target population sing a prior effect-size distribution estimated from the base GWAS summary statistics. To capture ancestry specific effects in the target population a BridgePRS also estimates a PRS using only the target population. BridgePRS combines these models to produce a single weighted PRS solution.","title":"Background"},{"location":"guide_background/#background","text":"PRS require as input summary statistics from genome wide association studies.

The pipeline runs multiple subprograms that are described below. Modelling overview Figure 1 of our Nature Genetics paper provides an overview of the modelling implemented by BridgePRS. The BridgePRS pipeline consists of five related subprograms which correspond to Stage 1 and Stage 2 analyses described in Figure 1. Stage 1 analysis is a single population analysis. Stage 2 uses the output from a Stage 1 analysis of the base population as a prior for the target population, this analysis produces model M1 in Figure 1. Stage 1 analysis of the target population produces model M2. Model M3 combines PRS from both Stage 1 and Stage 2 analyses. The final BridgePRS model is a weighted sum of models M1, M2 and M3. Model M1 reflects the belief that the target population GWAS is only informative in conjugtion with the base population GWAS. Model M2 reflects the belief that the target population GWAS is informative and the base population GWAS gives no addition information. Model M3 reflects the belief both the base and target population GWAS contribute independent information. Since apriori we do not know which of the three scenarios corresponding to models M1, M2 and M3 are true, BridgePRS weights these models to produce a single target population PRS. However, BridgePRS reports SNP weights and R2 in the target population for both the weighted model and M1, M2 and M3 enabling the user to use any of the four models. Subprograms 1) BridgePRS prs-single -- Stage 1 analysis to estimate models M2 and M3 2) BridgePRS build-model -- Stage 1 analysis for input into Stage 2 3) BridgePRS prs-prior -- Stage 2 analysis to estimate models M1 and M3 4) BridgePRS analyse combine -- Estimates models M1, M2, M3 and weighted model 5) BridgePRS prs-port -- Estimates target PRS without target GWAS prs-single -- Stage 1 analysis in the NG paper prs-single performs single population analysis.

The BridgePRS pipeline consists of five related subprograms which correspond to Stage 1 and Stage 2 analyses described in Figure 1. Stage 1 analysis is a single population analysis. Stage 2 uses the output from a Stage 1 analysis of the base population as a prior for the target population, this analysis produces model M1 in Figure 1. Stage 1 analysis of the target population produces model M2. Model M3 combines PRS from both Stage 1 and Stage 2 analyses. The final BridgePRS model is a weighted sum of models M1, M2 and M3. Model M1 reflects the belief that the target population GWAS is only informative in conjugtion with the base population GWAS. Model M2 reflects the belief that the target population GWAS is informative and the base population GWAS gives no addition information. Model M3 reflects the belief both the base and target population GWAS contribute independent information. Since apriori we do not know which of the three scenarios corresponding to models M1, M2 and M3 are true, BridgePRS weights these models to produce a single target population PRS. However, BridgePRS reports SNP weights and R2 in the target population for both the weighted model and M1, M2 and M3 enabling the user to use any of the four models.","title":"Modelling overview"},{"location":"guide_pipeline/#subprograms","text":"1) BridgePRS prs-single -- Stage 1 analysis to estimate models M2 and M3 2) BridgePRS build-model -- Stage 1 analysis for input into Stage 2 3) BridgePRS prs-prior -- Stage 2 analysis to estimate models M1 and M3 4) BridgePRS analyse combine -- Estimates models M1, M2, M3 and weighted model 5) BridgePRS prs-port -- Estimates target PRS without target GWAS","title":"Subprograms"},{"location":"guide_pipeline/#prs-single-stage-1-analysis-in-the-ng-paper","text":"prs-single performs single population analysis.
